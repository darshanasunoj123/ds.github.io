excerpt: 'We study how energy stocks respond to shifts in societal attitudes towards clean energy, with a focus on nuclear energy. A
theoretical framework sketches the relationship between uncertain public sentiment and investment levels. Using NLP methods, we
perform sentiment analysis on a corpus of textual data collected from public news sources published during the period 1980-2023.
Utilizing CRSP and COMPUSTAT data for a panel of nine energy firms, we examine the relation between public sentiment scores
and stock performance indicators in a fixed effects model. Finally, through an event study, we quantify changes in stock performance
caused by shifts in public perception associated with global policy events in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident. We
find that better public nuclear sentiment is associated with worse returns on nuclear stock. We propose a behavioral explanation and
the risk-return tradeoff as two alternate explanations for this finding.'
