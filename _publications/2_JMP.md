title: "Why Better Outside Options May Erode Bargaining Power"
collection: publications
category: Theory
permalink: /publication/1_JMP
excerpt: 'We study a dynamic bargaining setting with incomplete information and interdependent values in which the uninformed party has
an exercisable outside option. Unlike the private values case, interdependence introduces a double commitment problem for the
uninformed party with the right to exercise the outside option. As bargaining frictions vanish, the seller trades with the buyer as
long as profits are strictly greater than the expected value of the outside option and quits when indifferent. The main result of this
paper examines a curious upshot of the double commitment problem—a better outside option may result in worse outcomes. I
finally study an extension in which the uninformed party has the option of ‘burning’ the outside option and find an equilibrium in
which burning the outside option makes the player with the outside option better off.'
