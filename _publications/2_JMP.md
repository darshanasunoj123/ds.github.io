title: "Why Better Outside Options May Erode Bargaining Power"
collection: publications
category: Theory
permalink: /publication/1_JMP
excerpt: 'In theoretical bargaining, the outside option principle predicts that outside options are binding only at the margin. This paper
examines the validity of this result in an interdependent values setting. Unlike private values, interdependent values introduce a
double commitment problem for the uninformed party with the right to exercise the outside option. This naturally staggers trade in
equilibrium, breaking the outside option principle. The main result of this paper examines a curious upshot of the double
commitment problem—a better outside option may result in worse outcomes. I finally study an extension in which the uninformed
party has the option of ‘burning’ the outside option and find an equilibrium in which burning the outside option makes the player
with the outside option better off.'
