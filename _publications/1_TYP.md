collection: publications
category: Theory
permalink: /publication/2_TYP
excerpt: 'Studies a bargaining setting in which private information about outside options may be leveraged to extract larger shares of the pie.
A seller and a privately informed buyer negotiate prices in the shadow of an outside option that the seller receives stochastically and
privately. An equilibrium is constructed that features delayed trade over a period of time determined endogenously in equilibrium.
Trade probability is spread over this period with a large mass concentrated at the deadline.'
