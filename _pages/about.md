Hello! Welcome to my website! I recently graduated from Penn State University with a Ph.D. in Economics. My research interests include applied and theoretical microeconomics. In my doctoral thesis, I studied the role of outside options in negotiations with one-sided private information.

In my job market paper, I study common value bargaining settings in which the uninformed player has an outside option. I show that under some conditions, the uninformed player becomes worse off when her outside option improves!
