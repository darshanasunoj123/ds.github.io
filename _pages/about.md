Hello! Welcome to my website! I am an academic researcher with research interests in finance and applied and theoretical microeconomics. I graduated in August 2024 with a Ph.D. in Economics from Penn State and worked for a year as a researcher in Finance at the Sustainable Communities Lab at Penn State.

My current research as part of the Sustainable Communities Lab focuses on financing technologies in context of non-pecuniary motives for investment. In particular, we study the role of environment regarding motives and public risk perception in investment decisions with regard to nuclear stocks and develop optimal risk mitigating portfolio strategies.
